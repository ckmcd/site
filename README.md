This is the source for the Harmony Back-end Projects' [website](https://pages.github.hpe.com/harmony-be/harmony-be.storesfrontremote.com/). It is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

This repository has two main branches.  `master` and `gh-pages`.  Changes should be made to the `master` branch and tested locally.  Once the changes are complete they should be merged to `gh-pages` branch.  The main difference between these two branches is that the `master` branch is configured to be served locally and the `gh-branch` is configured to be rendered by GitHub Pages.

The `gh-pages` branch is rendered at the website as soon as the page is pushed to GitHub.
